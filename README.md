# CarAccidents
This repo is for using AutoML and InterpretML to predict car accident data.

This repository is where my team and I worked on predicting severity of car accidents.

In this repository, there are 4 folders Data, Presentation, Article, and Notebooks.

The Data folder normally would have has the .csv files of the data we used in this project, however they are too large for github. The link is provided.

The Presentation folder has our .pptx file of our graphs and slideshow presentation

The Project folder has my ipynb pandas file To begin running this data, download the data and reference it correctly in a pandas environment

The Article folder has the article my team and I wrote about our study.

This repository shows how InterpretML is used for ECB modeling. Global and Local explanations are made as well using InterpretML.
